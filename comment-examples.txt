The enemy of my enemy is my friend... Truth is, If The jews and muslims realizing they have been manipulated by America is the eventual outcome here. Moderation is the only path to peace.
-----
I've studied Islam and the cultures associated with it. Nobody, but the violent groups using theology to brainwash people, interpret those passages to mean "kill all unbelievers."


If that were true, why did Muhammad allow Jews and Christians to live in Medina? Why was Baghdad home to the largest Jewish population in the Middle East prior to Israel's founding?
-----
&gt; Many Jews are anti-Zionist 

A minority of a minority.
-----
Also, using a condescending tone by suggesting that I don't know what socioeconomic status or proportionality means does nothing to strengthen your argument.

Culture matters.   You of all people should know that,  being asian american.

How the hell does the U.S. government engage in slavery today?  Are you a Russian troll, seriously?

No argument on my end. Sounds like he made his motives crystal clear.
-----
And the rabbi from Tree of Life as well as several of its congregation members openly invited Trump and sought to not politicize the tragedy, but for some reason their remarks have not been nearly as widely quoted in this sub.
-----
That's what I mean. They have this faux outrage that some gay Americans are dead. Could you imagine the things they would be saying about gays if this was a love triange gone bad or something nonMuslim? They still won't discuss why it's okay for a christian to kill people at an abortion clinic.
-----
Bullshit.  Globalist may have some resonance with the small number of antisemites out there but it has an actual meaning.  

That has to be one of the most dishonest criticisms I've ever heard.  

The guy literally did not like Trump, said as much, and you are blaming Trump for his violence.  

That would be like blaming Obama for school shootings because he believes in abortion.

Your ability to reason is absolutely piss poor because you are so wrapped up in your own bias that you can't see anything from any other point of view. 

I can't imagine that you even have any friends being as self-absorbed as you must be.  
-----
&gt;This would be a valid argument if all Jews agreed with the current state of the zionist movement, which is not the case. 

Regardless, no true antisemite or neo Nazi is going to back Israel.  You don't have to like Trump or his supporters but equating all of them to Nazis is irrational.  I see a lot of anti-semitism on the far left consistently denouncing Israel while turning a blind eye to Palestinian offenses.  You can't have it both ways.
-----
There's that apathy! :)
-----
Let's not bring politics into this
-----
My point is that all these Trump acolytes are insisting that there is blame "on both sides" when one side is killing people and the other side is being brusque. Trying to conflate the two things.
-----
Downvotes are used to express disagreement - why does this seem like such a shocking thing to people? If I went to a conservative sub and started saying things people there disagreed with, I’d get downvoted too.

This is a group for a liberal city on a website that skews toward younger adults - is it so shocking that most people here downvote conservative opinions?
-----
Yes, you mean Antifa? Aka left wing terrorists? 
-----
Look in the mirror, people like you are the biggest hypocrites on earth
-----
Sure it does. Believing in conspiracy theories is a survival tactic.  If you well and truly believe that Jews are funding migrants to come kill you and your family, you could rationalize acting on that as self-defense.   
&amp;nbsp;   
The problem is that we’ve got people in high places agitating people prone to believe that shit with hate speech and goading them into action.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Attributing the power of hate speech to “mental illness” belittles the mentally ill (who are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators), and disconnects the promoters of hate speech from the results of their speech.  
-----
There’s a long history of racists associating Jewish people and money.
-----
&gt; I will add though that by supporting trump to are at least tacitly supporting racism and bigotry though.

Both corporate parties current platforms are implicitly racist. It's not like you can say only trump supporters are tacitly supporting racism. If you vote for a capitalist you're supporting racism. You aren't a good person because you're "less racist" than the nazis.
-----
Give, Osama likely did. The rest have been in leadership positions where others did their dirty work for them. You don't have to specifically tell people to go around killing Mexicans, but if you are spouting hatred towards them and making your followers hate them more and more, eventually you get what happened in El Paso.
-----
I mean we have video of Trump continuing his ravings against the press and spreading Soros caravan conspiracies, but sure... Let's just call that "opinion"...
-----
why do people conflate a dislike of this single man as a dislike of the jews. He's actively taking steps to do things that some people find shitty and they dislike him for that but they can't have that opinion without being anti-semites? 



-----
Even setting aside the obvious shout-out to white nationalism and link to a white nationalist website, you really shouldn't post signs stating that people of a certain ideology ought to die.
-----
That's maybe the clearest problem with this comic, but I have no idea what we're supposed to take away from it in the first place. If the idea is extremism is bad, does that mean civil and moderate racism and anti-semitism are okay? It's just so bland.
-----
You know what roads will be blocked and you know when it’ll happen. You have plenty of time to make other arrangements. If you don’t, you’re just making a victim out of yourself so you can cry about how the libs are oppressing you again.

Even with the conservatives pulling everything right, liberals have always been right of center tbh. Peoples idea of center is skewed by the overton window in the United States. The last time socialism wad even relevant to American politics was when Debs ran for president from jail and unions actually fought back against violent employers. Bernie Sanders is actually about center, but people think he's a far left extremist.

Yes, various character traits can be ascribed to Stephen Paddock; however, although it will never be known what his motive was, I for one belief that he was a nihilist, and whether it involves suicide, mass murder, or world annihilation, it makes no difference:

Considering that the vast majority of terrorism in this country over the past ten years is radicalized right wing violence, enough of them are for the label to stick, yes.   
&amp;nbsp;   
Once again, why are you trying to equivocate calling people “deplorables” with shooting up places of worship and attempting to assassinate the president’s declared enemies?  They aren’t the same, and you’re a lunatic if you think they are.   
&amp;nbsp;  
The simple fact of the matter is that if you think political violence is okay because you were called a name that hurt your feelings, you were fine with political violence from day one.  You just wanted an excuse.  
-----
Put your head in the sand and pretend we don't have a muslim terrorist problem in this country. Lynch says there are 1.1million people on the terrorist watch list. That should scare the hell out of you !

It’s amazing how folks who just pointed out how preposterous it was to unilaterally and unequivocally hate Trump and his visit are suddenly Cult 45. The opposition to the President is clearly its own cult, and threads like this with patently incorrect facts is demonstrative of that.

It’s also preposterous to point out the supposed astroturfing in this thread as benefiting any accounts that have opposed the general tenor of this headline when they have been downvoted to oblivion.

Some members of the congregation are democrats and some are republicans. Same applies to rabbi’s.

&gt; No, this stigmatizes the actual mentally ill who are more likely to be victims of violence than violent themselves. 

No, it doesn't. Mental disorders are not merely defined as ones that "you're okay with!" DSM covers an incredibly wide range of mental disorders, ones ranging from the benign to the dangerous. Pretending that all forms of mental disorder are benign is just as foolish as thinking they're all dangerous. 

&gt; People who hold strange or radical beliefs aren't necessarily mentally ill.

If you go out into the world and aggressively tell people that lizardmen have sent their Jewish offspring to destroy you and your family and those Jews need to be killed to save the world from the lizardmen, you are suffering from paranoid delusions and need mental health help. 

This doesn't change if you swap the word "lizardmen" out for the word "satan." Both are paranoid delusions. To argue otherwise is positively nonsense. 

Attempting to soft-pedal severe religious extremism as beliefs stemming from a "sound mind" is the kind of mentality that results in shootings like today's. That society doesn't look at religious extremism as a serious mental health issue means that nothing will change in society to get these people the treatment they need. They'll continue to create little echo chambers, society will continue to pretend nothing is the matter, and religious extremists of all shapes will continue to attack those they hate due to their paranoid delusions regarding groups of people different from them.

“America: go fuck your self, this shit is every man for himself and the only way we can be safe is to be a bunch of trigger happy sociopaths who can’t even team up to make sure we all can be taken care of. “ is what I heard. Enlightening shit though. I take it you’re a fashionable libertarian based on the stereotypical borderline nihilistic comment style. Is that about right? Or are you “even more” centrist and unaffiliated than libertarian?

We need $1,500,000,000,000.00 for a single failed military aircraft program when we already own a larger air force than any other planet on earth, BY FAR.

But ensuring access to preventive care and proper health insurance is just an evil government handout? Good lard that is igggggggnorant. You want to put all your damned faith in the corporate boardrooms at America’s insurance monopolies instead of democratically elected officials who at a bare minimum are subject to your vote? Lmao you clearly don’t understand how our species works. 😆😆

I am HAPPY to contribute to this society to the extent it requires  so that when some fucking cunt shoots into a crowd of people and paralyzes someone you love, that we make sure that your loved one gets ALL the fucking help they need to get better and try to get their life stabilized again.

You don’t have anybodies back but your own.  That is some weak shit pal. You are no countrymen of mine.

You ain’t no American, Your one of the ‘Muricans 😆😆

Trump has summoned what amounts to a cult, less a political party.  He was racist as a Democrat, reform party member, and independent too.

His response to Charlottesville was praised by the Daily Stormer (a neo Nazi newspaper) and he’s regularly refused to denounced racists.

He regularly promotes the “evil superpowered Jew controlling the world/media” narrative with George Soros.

That’s why stuff like this glares back at him.  It’s not even that I think he has beef with Jews (blacks, Muslims, Latinos, women), but he won’t turn off his supporters so he won’t use language that unequivocally denounces them (fine people).

For his many flaws, Clinton wasn’t constantly courting racists.

This guy wasn’t a Trump supporter but there has been a rise in emboldened white supremacists.  He also cited the “invaders” so labeled by Trump and Fox News.

The president should be above hate speech.  It’s not that he cares (he has no capacity for empathy), but yes, I believe he enables this behavior.
-----
OP wrote the title that he "hated organization**s** that support refugees", in reality, he hated a Jewish organization that supported refugees. He did not hate on Christian-based organizations that support refugees on social media.

Obviously he hated refugees, but his reason for the attack was to kill Jews. Which is why when he was caught, he was ranting about killing all the Jews, not killing all the refugees. 
-----
Do you even know what the fuck happened here? Calling me a child because I don't welcome a race baiting maniac to my city when I see a direct correlation between this terrorism and his words and the tone he has set?

-----
&gt; Many Jews are anti-Zionist 

A minority of a minority.
-----
When the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election refers to some of her fellow Americans as, “deplorables”, the left wing sphere bears responsibility for increasing inflammatory speech as well, right? 

Both “spheres” are a part of the problem. Not just the right. 
-----
More division and comparing people to killers. 

Actually disgusting.

The largest post on r/news regarding the shooting is 8 hours old and has over 5800 upvotes, yet isn't on the front page.  Yet you know what is on the front page?  A 9 hour old post with less upvotes talking about how many subscribers a video game lost.  This is absolutely outrageous.

Completely removed from the front page.  Mods of r/news and r/worldnews are locking and deleting threads and comments referencing this.  But it's not just them, it's Reddit admins themselves too.

Where's that red dot at the top of the front page linking to a mega thread like every other disaster?  

Trending subreddits are r/childrenfallingover and r/blackpeoplegifs?  Are you kidding me?  


EDIT:  12:30 [A one hour old r/askreddit thread is now the top post.](http://imgur.com/8qTg3pZ) Why is it coming from askreddit and what happened to the r/news and r/worldnews posts that are much older with more details?  Still no Live link from the Reddit admins.

EDIT:  12:55. I had made an edit showing the askreddit thread was removed.  That was user error on my part,  I was logged in at the time and am not a subscriber so it did not show on my front page. It is still present, though there is still no Live link from the Admins.

He's actually a friend of mine (as well as the owner and other employees of the shop). While I understand that his approach to this situation wasn't exactly right(from what I understand, but I dont actually know what was said, or *how* is was said, because I wasnt there), the owner of MOV is an amazing, caring person and I dont feel that this constitutes boycotting his shop or giving them terrible reviews based on a single employee. He got to the shop as quickly as he could the handle the situation and has been doing his best to clean up the mess. 

This also, of course, does not prove that the entire vape community is bad. 
-----
Yeah. “This is not Pittsburgh,” well, it kinda IS Pittsburgh (and America at large). The victims were our neighbors but don’t forget that the shooter was too. How did he/we get to that point? Do we have other neighbors in our city going down a similar path that he did? Probably! Is there anything to be done about that? A very difficult conversation that is easily dismissed by friendly euphemisms.  “oh, well...that’s not Pittsburgh...” it’s all Pittsburgh, the good and the bad...

Well, Cured would be our Jame Beard nominee. I think Hoppy Monk warrants some talking about with the menu, but is also based out of El Paso, so I'm conflicted. Big Bib and 2 M Smokehouse should be talked about. But, most important thing to follow here, I didn't write the article and am not here to do homework for someone else. If you make a claim, as a writer, you present evidence to support it. Duh. 

This is like me saying "Abe Lincoln is the best President. There have been many Presidents. He is even on a mountain. Presidents usually govern over America." Now do you see how I made a claim first? Then I breezed over with no substance and easy facts that could apply to any President? That is how this article is presented. I'm not sure why you're so stuck on defending it. If you wrote it, dude I'm sorry it's bad. And more to the point, most writers will face criticism on their work. That's why editors exist.  
-----
No, you’re being generally threatening and I don’t think it’s a stretch to say I’m not the only one uncomfortable here with your demeanor.

Yeah, I probably made it sound like I thought it was malevolant/conspiratorial, rather than just bad Reddit algorithms. And your experience is very different from mine. It took 4 hours before the Sessions' firing made my front page. And the protests didn't make my frontpage until yesterday morning, well after it was announced. I think they over-prioritize some of my lesser subs when showing me news, and I'm subbed to a lot of smaller ones, so /r/politics and /r/news often don't make it in my top 25.

Facebook definitely did not prioritize my sharing of the articles, though. That was confirmed by talking to friends.

Hey /u/PublicCommenter! What happened was the news agency involved (RT), that would have distributed the interviews/footage to news stations around the world, couldn't match the cost for filming what was needed for me and the camera person I was gonna hire to interview Rabbi Chuck - a key person for the package. So instead, I linked their field producer who they flew in from Germany to interview him and scheduled my own piece the next day.  

My thinking was, it would be cool to see him say whatever he wanted vs. have the media's spin on it. He chose to share a positive prayer for Pittsburgh. That piece can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/willypgh/videos/186763878906012).  

The news package for RT wouldn't have been a personal piece, no one would have known I produced it.  

We can still film at the drop of a hat if something relevant to the story were to crop up. (e.g. someone wanting to make a public statement.)

Now there are crazy wack jobs on radical forums calling for all kinds of craziness but people need to be smart enough not to listen to them......But in relation to this event I have never heard Trump calling for the killing of all Jews. I saw a report saying he didnt like Trump because he wasnt radical enough.

Do you have proof he had no money his house was large and more off from Vegas requiring extra gas to get to. It was necessary to correct since it just happened and now everyone want to just assume the thing that makes the most sense to them.

You can say what you will but you have no answers and aren't even looking for them.

A black Pittsburgher friend of mine wrote a very thoughtful and impassioned piece for Facebook about how this IS Pittsburgh, and we are finally seeing it openly...he was swarmed with so many angry comments from offended white people he took it down. He's right though. Just because Pittsburgh has a Jewish enclave doesn't mean we dont have anti-Semites. Racists live here and they've never been subtle. Just because some people might not have seen it until two weeks ago doesnt make it untrue. 
-----
&gt;the title seems to clearly be setting the crosshairs on Browning

yeah I could tell just by the title that this was obviously biased. Theyre trying to depict Browning as anti-gay. When in reality it seems that she was level headed and tried to explain exactly what the problem was. MacDonald on the other hand seemed combative and unwilling to see that he wasn't in trouble for the content of his statements, but rather the context.

There are many things that we don't know, I just hope that we hear the full story. My suspicion, however, is that the students and faculty will side with Browning.
-----
Globalist is an anti-Semitic dogwhistle. It’s an anti-Semitic dog whistle when the shooter used it (because he believes Trump is under the thumb of the so-called ZOG) and its an anti-Semetic dogwhistle when Trump uses it, even if he doesn’t know that. It’s a word he learned from his former bestie Bannon, but never bothered to learn it’s history. If he wants to do something good, he’ll stop using that phrase.

How, in your estimation, did Obama help incite that, other than also being a black man?  Obama never, ever once incited any sort of fear or division between blacks and whites.  The worst thing he ever said, if you could even call it that, was that he thought there was a problem with young black men getting gunned down in America, and he was correct.

I can't imagine how much chaos ensued at UPMC with the president's ego there.  The place is a circus on the best of days.

i think we agree here. some others were claiming it had nothing to do with recent events.
-----
That's horrifying. 

I find it weird that it isn't really being talked about on Reddit much. Any larger thread has become locked and/or comments all gone. 

Either way - extremely sad event. Seems like some people are saying it's not a terrorist act but a hate crime kind of thing? Regardless of the reasons... That's so many lives lost. Fuck.

Of course you would post from chapo

How exactly do you intend Congress to do anything? That would take another Constitutional Convention that removes the 2nd Amendment.
-----
It is set up like an echo-chamber since people can make threads go away they don't want to discuss.  It is an odd place, but people like to have simple confirmation in their beliefs, hence living in an echo-chamber is easy and makes those in it feel they are right all the time.  Sad and dangerous at the same time.

This manifesto is seeded with a lot of racist bullshit, but there are some surprisingly left leaning things in here too....or stuff you hear more left leaning people talk about. Definitely not right in the head, this one.

If only there was somewhere near the road to walk. On the side perhaps? We could call it a sidewalk or something

Compared to the midwest, this whole area is a mountain. Earlier today I was basically driving on top of a building because of how the roads work.

Yeah, there’s never people walking in the street directly after a sporting event on the North Shore...

Agreed.  Shotgun, handgun, rifle even archery available here.  Good prices, and the range masters aren't dicks.

I lived there from '06-'08. It is in the middle of the Haitian hood. The apt. itself was flea and roach infested, causing me to throw away a of of personal belongings; complex claims they did yearly inspections and pest control however, I never received a notice of completion. Other than that, I never had an issue with complex management.

Crime-wise, I personally didn't have issues though there were several close calls, including people knocking on my door at odd hours asking to use the phone or sell stuff. Helicopters flying around looking for people as well as gunshots were a daily occurrence. 

At the time, it was what I could afford and I followed common sense rules regarding personals safety. I still wouldn't send my worst enemy to live in that neighborhood.
-----
that's what it's looking like. i'm hoping for more concrete details by then, though.

I can’t imagine being so full of hate that you’d drive 9 fucking hours to do something like this. Clearly this guy has a lot of problems.

Waze is good but both services tend to have trouble with the tunnels/bridges during rush hour. Especially coming from Monroeville. It will typically add about 15 minutes to my ETA between leaving Monroeville and arriving at the tunnels. They default to wanting to take you thru the tunnels, but they don’t have a good method for handling inclement problems such as cars breaking down in the tunnels adding 20 minutes to the trip. Which I would be okay with, if it didn’t seem like it happens every f’ing day. (If it’s not that, it’s something else. Accident, construction, you name it.) I know everybody in the city has to deal with it, but adding in margin to a 60-75 minute commute is like asking a marathon runner to run a quick 5k the hour before their marathon.

I will have to try avoiding highways option. I have never tried that, to be honest. I’m curious how that will work.

So I just realized he is my neighbor. I didn't put two and two together until I saw his picture. I met him at our block party over the years. He lived a few houses up the road. I lent him a cooler this year that he put back on my porch with a few left over beers that I never got around to cleaning out. They are still sitting in there. 

My son would yell "hey what are you doin?" whenever he would walk by, and he would say "just walking".

I'm reluctant to go outside with all of the terrible events happening in my city. Every single place: The Plaza Live venue is a place I've seen shows at before, the Disney lake is a place I've visited more than 30 times at nighttime for the movies on the beach, I've partied at Pulse and many clubs in downtown Orlando, and I used to work at Disney Springs. All of these events are so close to me and a part of my most fond memories. I could have easily been one of these victims and I still could. Everything feels off and I don't feel safe anymore.

in it's current state, the west oaks mall is very much a "dying mall" in comparison to the other malls in the area. most of these pictures come from less than a week ago; no progress yet. the emptiness and desolate qualities are what's being focused on here. i'm hopeful for the future of this space, but i'm also hoping they don't screw it up.

Reports of shots at New York New York and also at Tropicana. Police are unsure if the calls are diversions.

I have a two bedroom house in Winter Park and I currently need a roommate. It's about 25 min from your workplace, but personally I drive another couple of miles each day to work at Disney, so I don't see much of an issue there.

If you're interested, the rent would be about $475 per person each month, plus utilities. I'm a 25 year old male, and generally a quiet and orderly roommate. [Here's a couple of pictures of the house](https://m.imgur.com/a/Ny6XQ). My last roommate left when his student.visa expired back in May, so I've had time to learn that paying about $1100 a month kind of sucks.

Former atlanta resident.  Pine Hills would be comparable to living on MLK drive in atlanta.  Avoid Metrowest as well... The weird part about this area are that parts of it look nice but people are murdered there pretty regularly.  Metrowest would be comparable to East Point.  Avoid the Melienna Mall area for the same reason most people avoid Underground Atlanta.
-----
From what I've seen, the regular police were on the 32nd floor right after the security guard notified them, but waited for SWAT since they didn't know what he had inside of the room(boobie-traps, explosives, etc). And, he had stopped firing, so it wasn't as urgent. But, I'm sure if he had continued to fire, they would have been in there without thinking twice.

It's still a low number of deaths compared to other fatalities.
-----
To reply to your edit, like any good investigation it has a focus but scope is NOT limited to only things found about collusion.  If evidence of unrelated crimes is discovered during the investigation they should absolutely be prosecuted, which is what has happened. 
-----
Well yeah. The trial has to be held in the district where the crime took place, the jury has to come from the same district. 
-----
In your other comment you say they died. I think all the articles saying they were injured tells us they’re likely not all dead. 

And that’s the whole thing. If the woman had access to a gun they would most likely all be dead. 
-----
If she acted on what she said she planned to do, those aware of it would be crucified for not intervening. 
-----
Chances are what you were hearing was the police weapons and their breach, the louder shots might've been flash bangs. The fast firing would be the police officer's automatic weaponry, actual assault rifles.


Are you still stuck at home?

I hope they kept him alive for interrogation

Both the FBI and Orlando police are lying about the events at Pulse.  In an attempt to cover-up the horrific consequences of their failure promptly to take out the active shooter, they have falsely claimed that there were "no shots fired" after 2:08 a.m., when they drove the shooter into the bathroom.  Tell that to Eddie Justice, who, as evidenced by his text messages to his mother, was murdered by the shooter some time after 2:51 a.m.--a full 43 minutes after law enforcement authorities claim that there were
"no further shots."
-----
An AR-15(5.56/.223 ammo) isn't powerful at all. Hunting rifles are more powerful, and can be fired just as quickly.
-----
Was he was given a Last Call at his funeral?

Not sure if you are aware of this, but there was a federal assault weapons ban already in effect at the time of the columbine shooting.

It was a little jarring to hear them start yelling “Contact! Contact! Shots fired! Shots fired!” with gunfire audible and hearing “Operator down!”

I’m banned from Pitt’s campus for allegedly doing so. So it’s definitely possibly I’d say!

We don't know that 18 people were killed or dozens injured. Latest reports say at least 10 dead, and there are 24 people confirmed to have been sent to local hospitals.

There was a suspicious “industrial looking” package in the entrance that they are getting technology and canine to anilyze for explosives

Are you suggesting that innocent people getting shot are crazy and not the terrorists?

The timeline:

Approx 2:00 a.m.--armed police officer serving as security outside
   the Pulse engages in gunfight with the shooter, but the shooter 
  is able to proceed inside the Pulse;
2:02 a.m. call goes out for all police to proceed to pulse, active 
  shooter;
2:04 a.m. about six to eight police officers have arrived at Pulse;
2:06 a.m.  Eddie Justice, a patron at Pulse, who like many has 
   fled into the bathroom to seek cover in the stalls, texts his 
    mother:  “In club they shooting;" Justice continues to text her
    for another 45 minutes, before finally being shot to death by 
    the shooter some time after his last text at 2:51 a.m.;

2:08 a.m.--
  According to Orlando PD, officers from various law enforcement 
  agencies enter Pulse and engage the shooter, forcing him into 
  the bathroom where Eddie Justice and more than two dozen 
  others are hiding in stalls.
  The shooter barricades himself in the bathroom.  The Police now 
  control all of Pulse except the bathroom.  Police make no effort 
  to break into the bathroom and take down the shooter, either at
  this time or subsequently.  Instead, they take a number of 
  injured Pulse patrons on the dancefloor, and possibly the patio,
  outside Pulse to receive medical aid.
     [It has not been disclosed how long this evacuation of injured 
      victims took. It also has not been disclosed whether police 
      remained in Pulse for the rest of the three-plus hours until the 
      shooter was killed, or at some point retreated.]

2:08 a.m. In a statement released on June 20, the FBI claims that the shooter fired no further shots after 2:08 a.m.; Orlando police
make the same claim repeatedly, including yesterday, June 26;
but, as set forth below, the claim is contradicted by at least one stream of text messages, those from Eddie Justice; 

----
 between 2:06 and 2:51 a.m.--Eddie Justice texts his mother many
  times

2:35 a.m.--The gunman contacted a 911 operator from inside 
   Pulse. The call lasted approximately 50 seconds. 

----

2:39 a.m.--Eddie Justice texts his mom again: "Call them mommy.
   Now." He writes that he is in the bathroom at Pulse.
   Mina Justice texts her son back and asks if anyone was hurt 
   and which bathroom he was in.

2:42 a.m.--Justice responds by text: "Lots. Yes," 
"He's coming.  I'm gonna die." 
2:46 a.m. Justice texts his mother again: "Still here in bathroom. He has us. They need to come get us."

2:48 a.m.--Officials say the gunman had the first of three  
    conversations with OPD's Crisis Negotiation Team, a call that 
    lasted approximately nine minutes.

2:49 a.m. --Mina Justice texts her son Eddie that the police were 
   there and to let her know when he saw them.
   "Hurry," Eddie Justice texts back, "He's in the bathroom with us."
    She asks in reply: "Is the man in the bathroom wit u?"

2:50 a.m.--Eddie Justice texts his mom: "He's a terror."

2:51 a.m.--Mina Justice receives a final text message from her son Eddie, a simple one word answer to her 2:49 a.m. text: "Yes."

She will not hear from him again.

Eddie Justice was shot to death some time after his last text to his
mother at 2:51, at least 43 minutes after the FBI claims that no further shots were fired by the shooter after 2:08.
Police say that the shooter was on the phone with them until 2:57
a.m.; it has not been disclosed whether he shot Eddie Justice to death during that call or after he hung up.

Join the lawsuit against him for it. It's an official channel, it was ruled he can't block people.

I think it's the fact that the gunman did what he did in the name of ISIS. ISIS is already known for murdering LGBT people in countries like Syria and Libya so whether or not the gunman was gay doesn't really matter because it is still an attack on LGBT people who have for the past few decades been fighting for their right to be respected like everybody else. Hell, the anniversary for the bill that was passed that acknowledges same sex marriage is in 10 days, not even a full year old yet. I think the reason a gay night club was targeted was specifically to give an even bigger punch by attacking a minority group that is already persecuted by ISIS.

No, the singer realized they were being shot at and bolted.

Mentally ill people are more likely to be **victims** of violent crimes than commit them. This guy went in shouting about killing Jews; he's not mentally ill, he's an anti-Semite.

It could just mean... they aren't done investigating yet.

I live in Kissimmee and used to live in Orlando for years. This is really a bizarre shooting. The gunman wasn't even from this area and he came here loaded to the teeth with weapons. Authorities are saying it was terrorism. Who targets a gay nightclub though??
-----
I imagine it will be fixed immediately after the authorities allow them to, it is still a crime scene under investigation. 
-----
CNN confirming in Twitter that suspect(s) in custody, but situation still considered active.

From the article: 

&gt;  Police arrested her and filed two counts of making terroristic threats and one of disorderly conduct, all misdemeanors.
&gt;  The next day, Linda Hanjorgiris reported to police that in an exchange of Facebook messages, Jarosh had told her she was going to “get my own AR-15 and start taking people out. First up is the the teacher and principal and everyone else can take a number.”


That seems like an actionable, credible threat.
-----
While I don't think we should have armed guards everywhere we go, I wouldn't use one example of a cop who failed to do his job as a way to say that armed guards everywhere are useless. Or separate armed police as guards from private armed security guards with no police training.

As we saw today with 4 officers shot, many police officers jump into the danger zone, not run away from it.

-----
Right, I understand the distinction between common law assault and battery. However, this is a statutory crime.  And even at common law you don’t assault someone by making a threat to a third person.  Simple assault in PA requires either actual intentional injury, negligent injury with a deadly weapon, “physical menace” putting another person in fear of imminent serious injury, or a concealed hypodermic needle.  

And that’s just misdemeanor assault, not felony.  Unless there are additional facts of which we are not aware, the felony charges are made in bad faith. 
-----
Probably to keep it from turning into another Boston-style Reddit detectives situation.
-----
question: was the shooter confirmed to be a gamer?

did they raid his house and find violent video games?
-----
You should know then that it's illegal to be carrying where alcohol is being served, because this is what we need, people drinking with guns on them
-----
One shooter, but it sounds like there are reports of more because of the police encountering people carrying guns (conceal or open carry, whatever it is there.)
-----
The media? Lol. I'm going by witness accounts. 
-----
You read it accurately. It is illegal to assault someone because of their speech and you can/will be criminally charged with assault or battery if you touch them or strike them, no matter how badly their views may piss you off.

 It’s not about being secure “against” someone, but having a readily available police presence at large gatherings of people. There is always a police presence at events, and I’m speculating that because of today’s extraordinary events there might not be officers available to be present at this event. 
-----
Since it's in federal jurisdiction, it'll probably be the unvited states vs this dude, not Allegheny county. So it has to remain within this federal district which covers all of western pa. Not sure how they choose a jury, but if it's everyone within that district then they have a large pool of people outside Allegheny county.

**Christian Zionism**

Christian Zionism is a belief among some Christians that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land and the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 were in accordance with Bible prophecy. The term began to be used in the mid-20th century, superseding Christian Restorationism.Traditional Catholic thought did not consider Zionism in any form. However Christian advocacy grew after the Protestant Reformation in support of the restoration of the Jews. A contemporary Israeli historian suggests that evangelical Christian Zionists of the 1840s "passed this notion on to Jewish circles", while Jewish nationalism in the early 19th century was widely regarded with hostility by British Jews.Some Christian Zionists believe that the gathering of the Jews in Israel is a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Jesus.

As /u/genericpseudonym678 pointed out in the other thread on this topic, the former president of the congregation who spoke against the visit was asked specifically her personal opinion, while the current leader was asked in his official capacity. We don't know whether that would have changed the rabbi's answer, but it's important context to remember.
-----
I heard on NPR after the San Bernardino shooting the government promised to help those victims but ended up stiff them with the cost afterwards which was mostly medical bills.  So not only do the survivors get to deal with horrible life altering wounds but they get giant medical bills.  The $75k is amazing but at unless a lot more is raised these poor victims are at a giant net loss financially.   Hopefully the local and state government step up too. 
-----
So Chicago bans guns. So now the majority of guns they recover are from outside of Chicago. So the law is ineffective?

What if we extended the law to the entire country, so there are no neighboring cities to get the guns and skirt the law? 
-----
Cash for guns programs have worked wonders in some places. We could try to incentivize that approach. We could also close gun show loopholes. And we can vote in politicians who won't accept money from the gun lobby. 

Lots can be done.

While I don’t disagree, the members of the congregation who were the actual victims would likely disagree on all counts. Perhaps they’re better people.

&gt; Do you understand the H1-B visa system?

It seems like you're the one who doesn't understand it.

&gt; It's arguably akin to slavery, since the person is beholden to one company and can't change jobs or have any recourse.

This is simply false.  You can transfer your H1B visa to another employer without major trouble. Thousands of people are doing this every year, especially in tech.

&gt; It's being used to undercut wages.

Please elaborate. I would like to see a reputable source stating the (mean) salary for H1B workers is lower than the one of domestic workers in the same field or that it's had any contribution to the decline in wages, since it's definitely not true for tech jobs.

&gt; Trump and the professional organizations favor a path that leads to citizenship and protects the immigrant - and that is clearly NOT an H1-B visa.

Again, untrue. Because if you were even remotely right, then the Trump administration would first go after L-1 visa rules that allow you to almost indiscriminately (and without quotas) bring in workers from abroad provided they've worked at your foreign subsidiary for more than a year. And on an L-1 visa you can't switch employers (it's not-transferable), unlike the H1-B.

In the future, you might want to check your facts before acting so condescending.

Actually, the homicide rate in england has been steadily on the climb since the 60s.. not that that increase has anything to do with their ban of firearms, but it certainly hasn't made people want to stop killing each other.
What I'm saying is that this country was founded on a set of unalienable rights and I strongly believe that preservation of those rights is important to the pursuit of individual liberty.
If you talk so highly of how countries who have never had widespread use of firearms for self defense, go there.

He went to Saudi Arabia twice.

I didn't say he should have been arrested, I say he should not have been able to buy the gun he used, which was NOT an AR-15, by the way. The gun he used required additional security clearance, which he was granted, despite his history with the FBI.

The 2nd amendment is the ONLY piece of legislation that will help protect innocents from people like this.

He WAS an ISIS recruit because he pledged allegiance to them, may have trained with them and ISIS confirmed the attack. You can't retroactively strip him of that association. Nice try though (not really).
-----
And he'll make the visit about himself, I guarantee it.  
-----
Shut the fudge up with gun regulation you think that taking guns away from people who follow the laws will help? You are absurd, then only the criminals and a very small percentage of people would have firearms the second amendment is to protect everyone from everyone not to give random people the ability to commit mass murder. Mass murder is what you want to be a part of our everyday life by only allowing governments with too much power the right to guns. This is America so glad you have your shit comments covered by my Constitution just like I do scrub.
-----
We have record gun sales year after year but gun crime has fallen since the early 90's. I won't argue they reduce crime, but they certainly don't cause it.
-----
I might be off base here but I don’t think it’s ethical to share this. Isn’t that precisely what the shooter wants?
-----
i agree it can get out of hand but headquarters has a pretty standard definition in corporate terms and it is worth the distinction from satellite offices.

What's even worse is people want to take rights away from people with mental illnesses. They want to make them second class citizens. Last time I checked, the constitution protected every citizen of the United States, not just those who are "free from disabilities" Very few mental illnesses predispose their sufferers to violence in the first place, despite what media shows. For every Hannibal Lecter type sociopath, there are hundreds of functioning relatively normal sociopaths. I know one personally. He's basically just an anti social dick, but he isn't violent, has never shown violent tendencies, he just doesn't care about people in general. I wouldn't strip him of his rights any more than I would take the rights of someone with Down's or Autism away.
-----
Just like California when Reagan was Governor, the quickest way to get the right to support gun control policies would be to start a campaign to put legal firearms into the hands of minorities and the left, and to have them brandish in public the way so many on the right do to attempt to achieve their political aims.
-----
Again, going through your list of violations:
1. Regardless of the president, every one of them has aimed to make the rich richer.
2. His implication was that there are rapists and murders among immigrants, which there are. The danger there is that undocumented immigrants have a much greater chance of getting away with it than you or myself as DNA evidence would link back to us.
3. Undocumented children were held captive BEFORE Trump got in office (research).
4. Trump stated when you're rich you can just grab women by the pussy in a private conversation he didn't know was being recorded. This isn't a habitual thing he does nor is it a behavior he publicly encourages. 
5. While I disagree with his environmental policy, I don't see how this can be used to push a label of "hateful".
6. I also agree he has made a fool of us multiple times. I also don't see how this can be used to push a label of "hateful"
7. How is he attacking trans people? I'm all for people living the lives they want but my understanding is that gender reassignment surgery is expensive and transgender people use military benefits to have this done. It's a cosmetic surgery and those funds should be reserved to save lives.
8. (Illega) immigrants. We still have a legal process for citizenship.
9. I don't have enough information to get into the birthright thing so I won't comment on it yet.

Additionally, I can't say I'm surprised that you brought up "White Privilege" which doesn't exist. When I first heard the term I listened to both sides of the argument and came across some very articulate videos. One that sticks out to me is a black girl (not famous) who showed clips from a "white privilege" video and picked it apart. There is a significant group of black Americans who are insulted by the notion of "white privilege" because they don't like being painted as victims. 

So don't think for a second that you're standing up for / speaking for minorities. You're taking a side there too. 
-----
I want the rights protected that prevent innocents from dying in a hail of gunfire and don't want the "rights" protected that allow people to subjugate others based on race. This is not a real decision we have to make. It's a false analogy that assumes no practical effect from the policies. Only in the complete abstract does it make sense.
-----
As long as they are part of a well regulated militia. Or is that part of the amendment too confining for you?

Alas, I am owned.

Not only is it, but it has been. Nobody from us would do this to our own city. We have been one of America’s safest cities and continue to be. Thank you for visiting and hope to see you soon! We all hope to expand our love and welcoming.

&gt; So Rosenstein still has his job as second-in-command, there's just no longer a reason for him to run the investigation, since the acting AG isn't recused.

There would be an announcement in a case when Rosenstein is replaced as head of the investigation. Not that it matters at this point, but Rosenstein should have recused himself when Sessions did, and for the same reason. Rosenstein was involved in the Russia investigation - he signed a FISA warrant in the case.

&gt; This is also why the current protest calls for the interim AG to recuse - because that would put Rosenstein back in place

Seems to me people on the left want Rosenstein in place for the same reason they're protesting Whitaker. They want a guy they feel is more likely to produce a specific outcome. 
-----
Eh, the city should be able to handle a strain of this level.  If a political visit and protests risk throwing the city into chaos because the police can't handle it, then something needs to reevaluated.  They handled the G20 in '09.
-----
It’s easier to prosecute somone for a hate crime then a terrorist crime as terrorist charges require specific motive &amp; psychological factors that are not requirements for a hate crime (which is itself an enhancement charge rather than a separate charge). Even the hate crime charge is often dropped by a prosecutor as there is little incentive to make the case harder to prove in capital murder cases, where there is no higher penalty to get anyways. 

Sorry this isn’t as sexy of an explanation as the conspiracy ones others have given. Has this guy even been officially charged with anything yet before people are already arguing about the specific named crime committed?
-----
Capital stock tax was phased out starting in 2016

The threshold is, when you have no other choice. Like, I'm imagining a family in which one of the parents is actually trafficking drugs while transporting their child, where that can be demonstrated, or where it seems highly suspicious they're not a "real" family, that the child is a prop and was probably already kidnapped for this purpose.

It should be used only when it's the least-bad of all other possible actions, such as simply turning them around. "Catch and release".
-----
Yeah, it's a much bigger problem than society not giving a fuck about funding mental illness programs at a proper level. 

You've convinced me, good point. /eyeroll
-----
I'll never claim that banning certain weapons will stop murders period, but I truly can't believe that lightening the power of those weapons wouldn't reduce the numbers of those murders. It's still really hard to stop someone who is using a 10 round shotgun, but it's much more possible to stop them and much more possible to survive their attack.
-----
Not only the Second Amendment, the State Constitution is even more clear and unambiguous - "The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned."
-----
&gt; To claim that the presence of protestors is proof that nobody wanted him here is just a lie.

I never said that. I'm sure there were some people who wanted him here - roughly 20% of the city voted for him, and some of them probably still approve of his performance. 

I just don't really see it as accurate to paint the visit as well-received based on a few medical staff obligated to meet with him in their own workplace for a photo op, versus many more people voluntarily showing up to a peaceful march, but I guess we can agree to disagree on the weighting.
-----
&gt;If you want to invalidate their experiences and qualifications as people to fit your narrative

&amp;#x200B;

"Hey, these people aren't Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh"

&amp;#x200B;

"Stop invalidating their experiences!!"

&amp;#x200B;

Can you not see how childish you sound right now?? Good night

It’s only been a day, they were confirming identities and informing families. 

And while I’m sure we may hear more about these people their families are grieving and may want privacy. 
-----
Yeah, it's a much bigger problem than society not giving a fuck about funding mental illness programs at a proper level. 

You've convinced me, good point. /eyeroll
-----
I don't doubt this is the case, and fully support any attempts to improve the performance of these non-profits (not sure what those avenues are, really) or even to disband the ones that are clearly not interested in doing good. But that seems somewhat distinct from the question of whether more (and more consistent) funding would allow these organizations to do more to help needy kids. Everybody here seems to accept that there is a need for more help, and there even seems to be general support for doing so at the county level to balance the scales between districts.
-----
Technically true title, but it will probably mislead some people.  He ordered it online and it shipped to a FFL in his area, which is how all (legal) online gun transactions occur.

&gt;Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin, said the process is similar to buying a foreign car — but with an added federal background check of the buyer at the local store.

From the article.
-----
He'll continue to say whatever he wants about the left and his followers will believe him, despite any facts presented otherwise. This was an act of violence, acts like these have increased and have been normalized partly because of the hate Trump spews at his rallies. But they expect 'the left' to be peaceful and/or stay home. I plan on attending whatever protest happens.
-----
Except that cars and computers aren’t explicitly designed for killing things. That’s the main difference.

 I asked my neighbor who's a local. El Pasoans is the correct term.

&gt; Sorry, incorrect. An H1B visa cannot be "transferred", a new employer has to apply for a new H1B visa for the employee, then the first one is cancelled. It's a difficulty, risky process, which is why essentially no one is doing it.

You are correct in that the new employer needs to submit a new petition. However, that petition is not subject to any caps and the employee can start working for the new employer as soon as the petition is received, without waiting for the approval. It's a major difference from a completely new H1-B petition, and that's why lots of people on H1-B visas regularly change jobs without issue.

&gt; Sorry, still incorrect, L1 visas don't work like you think they do. 

Yes they do. Companies can easily do blanket petitions and hand them out almost as they see fit. My L-1 process took a total of a month an a half from the first document to me entering the US and starting working. Compare that to H1-B, please.

&gt;Sounds like you may be confusing L-1 and H1-B visas, it's the opposite of what you posted.

&gt; FWIW, my company employs H1-B visa employees and we have been very frustrated that they cannot stay and have to leave the country. We prefer the L-1 visas since they provide a path to citizenship. While it's to our disadvantage that the employee can easily change jobs, it's more fair to the employee.

No, I am not. I'm in the US on an L-1 visa and know exactly the rules and regulations preventing me from changing employers. Please cite me any source that states an L-1 visa holder can change employers without going for another type of visa, such as H1-B. Here's a few stating exactly the opposite: [1](https://www.immihelp.com/l1-visa/faq.html), [2](https://www.immihelp.com/forum/showthread.php/227024-Job-switch-on-L1B-Visa), [3](https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/can-you-transfer-an-l1-visa-to-a-different-employe-3019605.html), [4](https://www.lawyers.com/ask-a-lawyer/immigration/what-si-the-best-way-to-change-job-on-l1a-visa-status-864818.html), [5](http://www.greencardlawyers.com/workvisas/L-1visas/FAQL-1Holder.html#Can%20I%20transfer%20or%20change%20jobs%20on%20an%20L-1%20visa)

&gt; I was not being "condescending" and the facts I posted are correct and easily verified.

Please do, I'm waiting for any data that backs up your claims.
-----
You didn't give me the 13% example. I gave you the 13% example. You gave me 6-7% without citing any sources and claimed similar demographics most US cities, again, without any sources. To me, it feels like your estimating and assuming statistics that suits your taste without properly citing or even attempting to cite legit sources. Though that's not the biggest issue we're having.

I think we're stuck on what disproportionate means. Say there are 100 ducks that can choose between 2 ponds. In pond A there are 30 slices of bread, and in pond B there are 70. Logically there should be 70 ducks in pond B and 30 in pond A. I'm saying disproportionate to me means that 90 ducks are in pond B and 10 are in pond A. If you understand my definition of disproportionate, then we differ on thinking whether or not it's okay for police to disproportionately target a certain group.

Though socioeconomic status may be different than culture, it certainly influences the culture someone grows up in. Socioeconomic status isn't just how much money someone has, it's the average earning, occupation, and education of the person themself and their family. Also, your distinction between culture and socioeconomic status is kind of alarming. It seems like you're suggesting black culture causes violence instead of their disproportionately lower socioeconomic status.

Right now is for lending support to each other. The Orlando United stuff seems a little hokey to me but it's true. We will help each other through this.
