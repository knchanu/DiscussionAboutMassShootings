You have to admit, him finding an ad for San Bernardino fitting a spot-on description of the event is rather ironic . . . plus, if you watch the video all the way through (I know, the guy isn't very interesting), he fact checks everything in the Craigslist ad down to the phone number . . . Not that \"conspiracy\" would demean death or mitigate anyone injured in any way .  . . but the US government, including agencies like the CIA and the FBI do not have a great track record of caring for the American Public.  Since the details of Sandy Hook and 9/11 have come to the forefront, people are suspicious.  Here's a link where 5 \"conspiracy theories\" happened to be true - http://www.businessinsider.com/5-conspiracy-theories-that-turned-out-to-be-true-2015-6\n\nYou don't think our government would intentionally hurt its citizens in the name of filling an agenda?",

They are usually done on a work day during a break period so only the employee is there, not their spouse. Even if the spouse was there (I have seen that happen a time or two but usually the spouse is also a County employee) cameras are usually not allowed in areas where Social Workers could be in possession of PII (personally identifiable information - Social Security numbers and such).\n\nAs far as some witnesses seeing three men in tactical gear - I believe that they are describing SWAT team personnel. I don't think anybody who was in the room of the attack gave any descriptions publicly. The attack from beginning to end was about four minutes. By the time anybody really knew what had happened the shooters were gone and the SWAT team was already on the scene. ",
